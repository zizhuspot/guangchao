## Who I am

Hello, my name is **"Dream Horse Galaxy "** and I am a **Smart City Builder and GISer**. I love life, technology, and borderline things, and am more than happy to share my experiences and insights with the hopes of connecting and learning from as many people as possible.

## My Practice

I have rich experience in **smart city construction, GIS software application** and **technology product "detoxification "**. I have accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience, as well as encountered a lot of challenges in the process of studying, working, starting my own business and writing blogs. These experiences have helped me grow and polish my personality and values.

## My Beliefs

I work so that I don't work later. What I want to tell you is **Science is a tool, but not a belief**, it's okay for you to love science, but you have to love life more.
