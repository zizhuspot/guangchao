description:A village in the north, famous for its hot springs resort. Graduates Feifei and Xiaojing are planning a vacation. Soaking in hot springs can be beautifying, and young girls love it. They have been to many hot spring
resorts, but all of them are overcrowded. Only one is located near the mountains and at the end of the hot spring village. It is an old house converted into a holiday inn, with a rusty sign. Strangely, the resort is always
shrouded in mist, making it look eerie. The inn is surrounded by mountains on both sides, like an ancient mansion that is enclosed. Looking at the price list, it is very cheap, 80 yuan per person with a discount for double
occupancy. "This is it. The hot springs are very good here." "Okay, let's go in." The reception hall of the inn is very dark.

A village in the north, famous for its hot springs resort. Graduates Feifei and Xiaojing are planning a vacation. Soaking in hot springs can be beautifying, and young girls love it. They have been to many hot springs resorts,
all of which are overcrowded. Only one is located near the mountains and is also the end of the hot springs village. This is a holiday inn converted from an old house. The rusty sign is even more strange as the resort is 
always shrouded in mist, making it look gloomy. The hotel is surrounded by mountains on both sides, making it seem like an ancient mansion that is being enclosed. 

After looking at the price list, it's very cheap, 80 yuan per person, and there's a discount for double rooms. "Let's stay here. The hot springs are great." "Okay, let's go in." The reception hall of the hotel is very dark 
and lit by candles. "It's so dark, and the candles are eerie," Xiaojing is a little scared. "It's okay. It sets the atmosphere," Feifei is a bold girl. 

The staff wears clothes from the last century and walks heavily. "Please," they were led into a room. The furnishings inside are very old-fashioned. Because it is in the mountains and near the hot springs, there is a 
mixture of sulfur and musty smell that has overwhelmed Xiaojing and Feifei. "This smell is so strange," Xiaojing opened the window. But the scenery is still beautiful with the chirping of birds and the sound of hot springs 
waterfalls. 

The lighting in the room is still candles. The staff also placed several unlit candles for them before leaving. Xiaojing and Feifei soaked in the hot springs and ate farmhouse food. It was already late, 10 o'clock, and they
were ready to rest. Xiaojing was tired and fell asleep as soon as she lay down, while Feifei had no intention of sleeping and was probably excited. 

The sound of banging came from outside, waking Feifei up. The sound came from the corridor outside, not someone knocking on the door but someone clapping their hands on the floor. The sound disappeared, and Feifei was also 
sleepy. Just as she fell asleep, the banging sound came again, this time in the corridor outside the door. Feifei got up and walked to the door, looking out through the keyhole. It was all red, bright red. Bang! Bang! Bang! 
Someone was knocking on the door, and at the same time, that strange smell appeared again, making Feifei a little scared. "I want to come in..." Bang! Bang! Bang! Someone spoke, it was a woman's voice. Feifei was so scared 
that she hid behind the door. "I want to come in..." Ah! Feifei screamed loudly...[omitted]
